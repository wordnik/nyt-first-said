The stores earmarked for \xe2\x80\x8bclosure from February 2 include one in suburban Shanghai, another in Guangzhou, and \xe2\x81\xa0several more in second-tier Chinese cities such as Nantong, Xuzhou and Harbin, IKEA said in a post on its official WeChat account.
Retailers in general have been \xe2\x80\x8cstruggling to \xe2\x80\x8bgrow sales in China, where consumer sentiment remains muted \xe2\x80\x8dfollowing a prolonged property crisis and concerns about employment security and stagnant wages.
About 40 IKEA stores are in mainland China, and the company said five new stores \xe2\x80\x8bof various sizes had recently opened.
China, \xe2\x80\x8cthe world\'s second-largest economy, accounts for about 3.5 per cent of IKEA\'s global sales.
\xe2\x80\x8bWith a growing percentage of sales in the country \xe2\x80\x8dcoming from online flagships, IKEA opened a new store on JD.com last August to help cultivate \xe2\x80\x8bthat \xe2\x80\x8bonline sales growth.
"We will \xe2\x80\x8bshift from scale expansion to \xe2\x80\x8bprecise cultivation, exploring Beijing and Shenzhen as key markets, and opening more than 10 small stores in the next two years," IKEA said, adding that new store openings in Dongguan and Beijing were expected in the \xe2\x80\x8dfirst half of 2026.
